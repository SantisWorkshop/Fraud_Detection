# Fraud_Detection
In this project we use tree-based methods to detect fradulent online transactions using the data here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/online-payments-fraud-detection-dataset (Note this data set is too large to include in the repository)
This project uses bagging and random forests on a data set containing over 6 million transactions and 8 predictors.
Due to hardware limitations our methods use 100 trees. As we will see, this yields good results.
